  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What is it and why I want to work on that</h2>

<p>I hope the name is brief and clear on what it should be although I was worrying whether it brings an illusion that it&rsquo;s telling you to <em>&ldquo;Take your time.  Slow down.&rdquo;</em>.  Actually, it&rsquo;s where to take the time seriously and you can keep track of your time.</p>

<p>Why would I want to do such a seemingly boring thing?  There are three reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For those who really cares about their time, they really want to find some effective way to make their time used effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been working in two software companies which both require staffs to input TIMESHEET!  Yes, we all know it&rsquo;s bullshit, meaningless and most of the figures are made up, but it&rsquo;s just required.</p>

<p>  I can understand that part of the objective is good, just like what this pet project is made for. However, mostly it&rsquo;s just some policy or resource monitoring required by boss.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice my development skills with some of my favorite tools by doing real work.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Hence, I am trying to make an easy-to-use application for those who want an effective time management.  The design is basically following my <a href="http://www.thinkingincrowd.me/blog/2012/12/24/my-practices-on-time-management/">practices</a> of it and the principle of simplicity.</p>

<h2>What does it look like</h2>

<p>It should be simple in general.</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a GTD-style task web application.</li>
<li>It can plan, track and retrospect the tasks.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to capture the time</h2>

<p>No matter you are planning tasks or actually tracking the tasks done.  You need to capture it.  There are many elements need to write down:</p>

<ul>
<li>For planning tasks: Task content, Start/End date and Estimated how long it needs.</li>
<li>For tracking tasks: Task content, Start/End date, Start/End time and how long it takes.</li>
</ul>


<p>The elements in tracking tasks covers all we need for planning tasks, hence the capturing UI should be able to unified.  Below is the draft UI designed:
<img src="http://thinkingincrowd.u.qiniudn.com/task_capture.png" alt="Capture UI" /></p>

<ul>
<li>By default, there is a task content textbox.</li>
<li>After you input something, some additional text and input boxes are shown.</li>
</ul>


<p>You should probably be able to guess how to use it already (if not, let me know how to make it happen):</p>

<ul>
<li>If you input the task name and press &ldquo;<em>Enter</em>&rdquo;, you start your task immediately.</li>
<li>If you input the task name and the duration it takes and press &ldquo;<em>Enter</em>&rdquo;, you are tracking a task just finished.  It&rsquo;s calculated based on the current time and the duration you input.</li>
<li>If you also fills a specific date in &ldquo;<em>yyyy-MM-dd</em>&rdquo;, you are planning tasks if it&rsquo;s a future date; you are tracking tasks if it&rsquo;s a historical date.  The last &ldquo;<em>hh:mm</em>&rdquo; field is optional for the task start time.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why design like this</h2>

<p><em>4</em> fields with some easy to explain text made it can be read as a sentence.  It should be natural to fill in what is required.  And when you press &ldquo;Enter&rdquo; at any field, it will do different things automatically.  It should be simple enough but satisfy all the requirement.</p>

<p>I have been thinking how to capture the duration.</p>

<ul>
<li>Two fields separately for hours and mins (This app is not designed for those crazy people who need to capture seconds).</li>
<li>One field for all.</li>
</ul>


<p>Approach <em>#1</em> looks natural but needs an extra field and more key-stroke.  By taking <em>#3</em>, decimal number need to be used to express minutes.  You may question me that calculating decimal is even harder.  But think it this way:  <em>.25</em> is <em>15</em> mins; <em>.5</em> is <em>30</em> mins; <em>.75</em> is <em>45</em> mins; <em>.1</em> is around <em>5</em> mins.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s not that difficult to use decimal to express it.  What is more, when you are actually tracking your task this way, you are guessing or trying to remember how long it took.  Your mental power is &ldquo;calculating&rdquo; somehow to get a number.  If it&rsquo;s one field, you just need to do one calculation and input.  If it&rsquo;s two fields, you might possibly calculating two fields, especially when your task start time is say from <em>2:35</em> to <em>4:08</em>.  I think it just doesn&rsquo;t matter if there is minor inaccurate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The 101</h2>

<blockquote><p>Time Management is the act or process of planning and exercising conscious control over the amount of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency or productivity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Everyone who cares about their time should be familiar with this concept and knows its goal &ndash; to increase effectiveness.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management">Wiki</a> site covers different aspects of it.</p>

<p>Here I would like to share my understandings and what my choices are to make good use of my time.<br/>
1. Planning &amp; Prioritizing<br/>
2. Protecting thy time<br/>
3. Identifying waste</p>

<h2>Planning &amp; Prioritizing</h2>

<p>Planning &amp; Prioritizing is a must.  It helps us not losing any task we have to do but also makes sure we do the most urgent &amp; important ones first.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> is a great methodology.  However, <strong>DON&rsquo;T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THE LIST.</strong>  You cannot prioritize or categorize your tasks if the list fills with tons of items especially if you have some level of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder">Obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>.</p>

<p>I have the same issue stated in <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2012/10/28/my-15-minute-rule-to-productivity/">My 15 Minute Rule to Productivity</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ll delay doing something that I know is important until the last moment that it needs to be done.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hence, my rule on making a list is: <strong>Make a task list only for the tasks I need to do TODAY and come up an estimated time on how long to take it.</strong>  How if I have something important to do in the future? Put it to calendar/reminder and also include an estimated time so that this task will go into my future TODAY task list.</p>

<p>And then the rule of picking the task from a list is: <strong>Scan the tasks and their estimated time; Pick the one I MUST start it.</strong>  This action is to take out the most IMPORTANT and URGENT task which is actually prioritizing.  The estimated time made in the first step helps me know when it is the right time to pick which task.</p>

<h2>Protecting thy time</h2>

<p>What does this mean?  It means avoid distraction.  Distraction is the major time killer which makes us ineffective.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> is the one I like.  It imposes an external mechanism (a timer here) to keep us focus on work for a short period (generally 25 mins) and also have some rest inbetween.  The rest in between the working period can be used to reply your email, IM or actually relaxing your mind.  Its working style is like marathon which needs constant pacing.</p>

<p>However, this mechanism might have an issue to some knowledge worker.  Here is the view in one of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000068.html">Joel Spolsky&#8217; article</a> with which I totally agree:</p>

<blockquote><p>We all know that knowledge workers work best by getting into &ldquo;flow&rdquo;, also known as being &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo;, where they are fully concentrated on their work and fully tuned out of their environment. They lose track of time and produce great stuff through absolute concentration.<br/>
&hellip;<br/>
The trouble is, getting into &ldquo;the zone&rdquo; is not easy. When you try to measure it, it looks like it takes an average of 15 minutes to start working at maximum productivity.  Sometimes, if you&rsquo;re tired or have already done a lot of creative work that day, you just can&rsquo;t get into the zone and you spend the rest of your work day fiddling around, reading the web, playing Tetris.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hence, the Pomodoro Technique might knock you out of the zone and you should choose your own timer based on the average time you can maintain your flow state instead of 25 minutes.  Or you can just let your flow flows until you think you need to get a break.  The point is to try to maintain some continuous period to get uninterrupted.</p>

<p>But generally, Pomodoro is helpful under certain circumstances like management level people who don&rsquo;t even have continous time more than 25 minutes or some working environment has interruption often or someone whose productive time shorter than 25 minutes and want to extend their flow state.</p>

<h2>Identifying waste</h2>

<p>Planning is the starting process of time management, while identifying the waste is the retrospect process.  Sometimes, it&rsquo;s even more important than the planning.  That is because planning is working on something uncertain, while retrospect is based on reality and intended to make improvement.  History and fact can tells us more on the our regular time usage pattern.</p>

<p>How to identify waste?  Track the time and see where your time spends.  Our memory is unreliable to keep track of how long we spend on the things done.  We need to actually write it down and write it down when it happens (at the beginning or the end of the task).</p>

<p>By tracking where the time we spend, we can find out where the waste is and try to eliminate it.  Also we can consolidate those discretionary time slots to a continuous unit for more effective usage.  There is a wonderful chapter &ldquo;Know Thy Time&rdquo; in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Drucker-Series-Peter/dp/0750643900/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356302486&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=The+Effective+Executive">The Effective Executive</a> by <em>Peter F. Drucker</em> describing how to make good use of time.  Highly recommend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>My ignorance</strong><br/>
When I first switched to use <a href="https://github.com/masylum/connect-mongodb">connect-mongodb</a> to replace the MemoryStore in <a href="https://github.com/senchalabs/connect">Connect</a>, I found that the homepage of my pet project cannot be even loaded and it seems the response is kept waiting there.  If I switched back to use MemoryStore, it&rsquo;s all fine.  There must be something wrong when I am using <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> for session management.</p>

<p>First, I dig into the <em>session.js</em> in Connect.  Around line 267:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After opening the debug feature in <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a>, I found that it&rsquo;s never going into the callback of <em>session.save()</em>.  Hence, the &lsquo;saved&rsquo; message is never printed in the console after &lsquo;saving&rsquo; and the response is never ending.</p>

<p>Why would this happened?  I kept tracing the code and found that <em>session.save()</em> in Connect is calling the <em>sessionStore.set()</em> method.  The <em>MongoStore.set()</em> method in <em>connect-mongodb.js</em> is just purely calling <em>collection.update()</em> and no much magic there.  However, it seems the <em>update()</em> method call has either no err and data coming back.  Is there something wrong with the MongoDB or the Collection?</p>

<p>MongoDB log doesn&rsquo;t seems to have any query or update action recorded and I just found that there are 10 connections started every time I started my app, but I remembered there were 5 connections (default pool size) before (Actually, I haven&rsquo;t noticed that this is the phenomenon of the problem I have at that time yet).</p>

<p>Without any clue, I checked the initialization of the MongoStore and find below code:</p>

<p>It turns out that the flow goes into <em>server_config.connect()</em> again.  But why?  DB should be initialized in below code which is intended to encapsulate all DB operation.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with Node, you may have already noticed what I haven&rsquo;t done right here.  I am assuming the DB should be connected and ready for use already as I have called <em>db.open()</em> during DbManager&rsquo;s construction.  However, Async is the most importance concept in Node, <em>db.open()</em> takes my callback will immediately return and it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee it&rsquo;s opened already.  If I change to below code, problem solved.</p>

<p>Finally, the root cause is found.  Normally, when <em>db.open()</em> is called, it sets its <em>_state = &lsquo;connecting&rsquo;</em>, and it then will call <em>server.connect()</em> to create connection pool and in the callback, it sets its <em>_state = &lsquo;connected&rsquo;</em> again.  However, my case is that the second call <em>server.connect()</em> in MongoStore.js first make the first connection pool stops and then creates a new connection pool again(This should be where makes the mongo db log has 10 connections opened).  Somehow, the callback in normal flow cannot be executed so that <em>db._state</em> has not been set to &lsquo;connected&rsquo;.  What is more, the callback set in <em>MongoStore.js</em> doesn&rsquo;t set the <em>db._state</em> to &lsquo;connected&rsquo;.  The <em>db._state</em> is remained in &lsquo;connecting&rsquo; forever which makes my update command keep pushing to its commands stack.</p>

<p><strong>Most appropriate way to initialize MongoDB and its connections in Node.js</strong><br/>
I began to wonder what is the &ldquo;most appropriate way&rdquo; to initialize MongoDB and manage its connections and googled around.</p>

<p>At first, I found a similar question asked in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10656574/how-to-manage-mongodb-connections-in-a-nodejs-webapp">StackOverFlow</a>.<br/>
However, the reply doesn&rsquo;t seem to be reasonable.  It recommands opening a new connection (actually, a DB and Connection Pool there) per request.  And it said it&rsquo;s due to MongoDB is asynchronous.  It&rsquo;s pretty confusing and the asynchronous mechanism in Node should be achieved by callback instead of creating new connection per request.  If so, what is the point of using pool then?  This approach should be more slow.</p>

<p>Later I found out a reply from the author of node-mongodb-native in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10307994/where-can-i-find-complete-documentation-concerning-node-mongodb-native/10349450#10349450">StackOverFlow</a> too.  It clearly stated &ldquo;DO NOT call open on each request.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I believe only opening MongoDB once with appropriate pool size and initialize node application in the <em>db.open()</em> callback should be the right way to go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>首先, 我先要说明一下, 这里的“多维度”可能并不太准确.  这里说的并不是数据仓库里的维度, 而只是数据的属性.</p>

<p>举个例子可能就比较好明白了.</p>

<p>比如, 如果你上京东, 或者苏宁一些网上商场买电脑, 上面一堆的过滤条件 (比如: CPU, 内存, 硬盘等) , 其实就是电脑的属性, 也就是我这里说的数据 (电脑) 的维度。</p>

<p>我最近做的一个系统模块, 其实就是关于数据维度匹配和使用的.  这个模块的大概原理是这样的, 根据一些输入的数据维度值, 在数据库内寻找出维度值和输入的维度值不冲突的数据.</p>

<p>假设数据库现在想保存的数据是眼镜的资料, 那么这些数据的维度有: 材料, 颜色, 设计 (半框, 全框, 等), 面向人群 (青, 中, 老), 面向性别(男, 女).  我现在要做的模块就是当一个人来了, 我把他的相对应的维度 (性别, 喜欢的颜色, 设计, 材料, 等), 输入到数据库中查找匹配的数据 (眼镜), 系统应该要拿出和这个人要求不冲突的.</p>

<p>这个模块要怎么设计呢?  数据库的表要怎么设计呢?  这里假设系统用的是JPA Entity和Oracle DB.</p>

<p>首先应该有一个表是存储了眼镜的信息的 (UUID, 名称, 厂家, 等).  一般来说, 刚才的那些关于眼镜的属性也就是数据维度, 自然的想法, 当然也是放在同一张表里面, 也就是用表里面不同的列, 来存放不同的维度, 比如:</p>

<p>表 GLASSES的列有:</p>

<p>| UUID | 名称 | 厂家 | 材料 | 颜色 | 设计 | 面向人群 | 面向性别 |</p>

<p>那么, 假设一个喜欢红色半框设计眼镜的男人来找眼镜, 根据输入来查寻数据的SQL就会是类似:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM GLASSES
WHERE 设计 = '半框' AND 颜色 = '红' AND 面向性别 = '男';
</code></pre>

<p>但是, 其实要找出和这个人要求不冲突的眼镜, 情况并不是这样子的.</p>

<p>比如说, 很可能GLASSES表里有些眼镜, 它的某些属性列为空, 假设有一款眼镜并不指定面向性别.  你可能会说SQL就要变成这个样子:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM GLASSES
WHERE (设计 = '半框' OR 设计 IS NULL)
AND (颜色 = '红' OR 颜色 IS NULL)
AND (面向性别 = '男' OR 面向性别 IS NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>但是, 也有可能这个人对设计没什么偏好.  如果是这样的话, 那可能你就要动态生成SQL, 也就是这个人如果哪个条件没有要求, 哪个条件就不加到SQL里面, 比如对设计没偏好:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM GLASSES
WHERE (颜色 = '红' OR 颜色 IS NULL)
AND (面向性别 = '男' OR 面向性别 IS NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>到这里, 问题就比较清楚了.  如果从写代码和DB设计来考虑, 属性做为表的列来设计的话, 我个人觉得有几种不好之处:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>如果以后要添加或者删除属性, 表结构要不断改变, 代码也要不断改变来生成各种组合的动态SQL.</p></li>
<li><p>从SQL的特性 (条件不确定, 维度组合多) 来看, 并且如果维度或者说列多的话, 为每一个维度创建index也不太可行, 查询效率也不高.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>所以, 自然的, 我把数据维度的值, 设计成存储在子表里, 结构示例如下:</p>

<p>表GLASSES_ATTRIBUTES:</p>

<p>| UUID | GLASSES_UUID | 维度类别 | 维度值 |</p>

<p>这样的话, 上面的SQL就转换成:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM GLASSES G
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
      FROM GLASSES_ATTRIBUTES GA
    WHERE G.UUID = GA.GLASSES_UUID
              AND (
                    （维度类别 = '颜色‘ AND 维度值 &lt;&gt; '红色')
                     OR
                    （维度类别 = '面向性别‘ AND 维度值 &lt;&gt; '男')
                    )

<p>这条SQL也是需要动态生成的, 也就是最里面的OR的部份.  如果一款眼镜, 它没有定义特定的维度, 那它在子表里面就没有记录, 也满足要求.  如果是那个人没有什么特殊要求, 也就不需要生成特定的OR的部份.</p>

<p>这种实现方法, 个人认为相对来说好处有:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>虽然SQL也要动态生成, 但是变化的部份从表的列名, 转换成数据值, 逻辑会相当简单, 减少一些Hardcode的成份.</p></li>
<li><p>数据库表GLASSES_ATTRIBUTES可以创建一个维度类别+维度值的复合index就可以了</p></li>
</ul>


<p>不过, 老实说, 我也不敢肯定后面一种SQL的查询效率会高点, 因为也会有比较多OR的条件, 并且还要用上NOT EXISTS.  我曾经测试过在GLASSESE里有6W条记录, GLASSES_ATTRIBUTES上有37W条记录的环境里, 用3个维度(也就是3个OR组合), 找出1W条左右记录, 大概0.01秒.  用6个维度, 找出1K条左右记录, 大概0.1秒;  用11个维度, 找出15条记录, 也大概0.2秒左右.  所以, 看起来, 好像还可以.</p>

<p>其实, 我在这里把数据的维度值用行记录来存储, 而不是列值, 还因为实际的系统需求, 还有更多复杂的要求.  再举一个纯属搞笑的例子, 但实际原理是一样的.</p>

<p>比如一个女的要征婚, 她列下了一些要求, 也就是&#8221;如果男的xxx, 就要准备yyy之类的.   xxx就是数据 (男) 的维度, 比如年龄30以上, 或者帅, 等.  yyy就是需求, 比如有房, 有车,  年薪,  爱宠物什么的.</p>

<p>这里呢, 会有3个表:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>主表 &ndash; 这里的每一条记录, 代表一份要求</p></li>
<li><p>维度子表 (CONDITIONS) &ndash; 存的是归到这份要求, 男的情况是什么, 如年龄30以上, 不帅</p></li>
<li><p>需求子表 (REQUIREMENTS) &ndash; 存的是归到这份要求, 男的要准备什么, 女的才会嫁他, 如车30W以上, 房要50W以上等</p></li>
</ul>


<p>系统的行为, 就是当把一个男的所有情况输入进去, 就会找到所有女方的需求是什么, 都组合在一起, 作为总的要求.  这种情况下, 系统就复杂了.  比如主表有三条记录A, B, C.  维度和需求分别是:</p>

<pre><code>CONDITIONS:

| A | 年龄 | 30以上 |
| B | 相貌 | 不帅 |
| C | 相貌 | 不帅 |
| C | 宠物 | 不讨厌 |

REQUIREMENTS:
| A | 车 | 20W以上 |
| B | 房 | 50W以上 |
| C | 房 | 40W以上 |
| C | 车 | 有 |
</code></pre>

<p>看得明白吗?  假设一个男的30以上, 那他就要有20W以上的车才行了.  如果他又不帅, 但是讨厌宠物的话, 就要加上50W以上的房了.  既然需求有组合的情况, 不知道你们有没有想到一些问题, 就是需求是否会有冲突.</p>

<p>假设男的30以下, 不帅, 不讨厌宠物, 那查询出来的记录就是B和C, 那这里会同时对房有要求, 但这种情况, 不算有冲突, 因为C的Codition是包含了B的, 所以只要有车和40W的房就行了.  但是如果男的30以上, 不帅, 不讨厌宠物, 那就A, B, C都是满足条件的, 但是A和C对车都有要求, 选哪个呢?  这时就要解决冲突了, 其中一种做法, 就是在不同的Condition上, 加上比重, 比如年龄看重点, 宠物看轻点, 那就以A的为准, 要20W以上的车了.</p>

<p>好玩吧?  所以, 把数据维度设成行记录来存储, 还可以把不同维度加上其它一些设置, 如比重等, 配置起来会比较方便.</p>

<p>不知道大家有什么意见?  欢迎拍砖.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ajax is a pretty common used feature now for every JS Rich application. How to test it is common headache for many application.</p>

<p>ExtJS has been adopted in the two companies I worked and am working for.  Hence, here I only show you how to test Ajax in ExtJS built application.</p>

<p>In my previous post <a href="http://www.thinkingincrowd.me/blog/2012/08/13/extjs-jasmine-unit-test-part-1-philosophy-and-test-for-store/">ExtJS, Jasmine, Unit Test – Part 1 (Philosophy and Test for Store)</a>, the part on how to test Autoload <em>Ext.data.Store</em> simply override <em>Ext.lib.Ajax</em> so that it does nothing and <em>Ext.data.Store</em> is tested through manual loading data.</p>

<p>That is the simplest way but cannot fulfill the requirement to test real production code which uses Ajax feature.</p>

<p><strong>How real production code might look like if the application is built entirely by ExtJS?</strong></p>

<p>Above is a simple UI implementation class which extends from an UI class.  You can safely guess that this UI class simply has one name field which is bound with a Blur Event.  The Blur Event handler triggers an Ajax calls to validate whether the typed-in name is empty or duplicated within the system.  Pretty straightforward, right?</p>

<p><strong>Considering the Test Philosophy I mentioned in my last post, what contracts or behaviors we should test against here?</strong></p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<ol>
<li> Contract between user and our system (blur event).  I would expect there would some code like this in my Jasmine Spec:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">oUI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">nameField</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">fireEvent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;blur&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ol>
<li> Contract between backend data structure and frontend handling on Ajax call.  I am expecting if I set the <em>responseText</em> from Ajax call to be not empty, the <em>nameField</em> in UI should be marked as invalid and show the <em>oUI.duplicateNameWarningMsg</em>.  Say, the response can be stub as:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">Ext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">lib</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Ajax</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">response</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">status</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">responseText</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Duplicate&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ol>
<li> Contract between implementation logic and UI behavior experienced by user.  The point mentioned above that <em>nameField</em> in UI should be marked as invalid and show the <em>oUI.duplicateNameWarningMsg</em> or <em>oUI.emptyNameWarningMsg</em> under different situations<strong>.</strong> Sample Spec code might be:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">oUI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">nameField</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">fireEvent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;blur&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">oUI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">nameField</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getActiveError</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="nx">toEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">oUI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">emptyNameWarningMsg</span><span class="p">);</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ol>
<li> Other Contracts (e.g. Hardcode global variable or Element Id).  Why this is needed?  Because this where most of the change happens but it&rsquo;s very difficult to be aware of.  Sample Spec code might be:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">oUI</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Ext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getCmp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;kentest&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>The Test Spec is already in mind but how can I use it to test against the production code?  </strong></p>

<p>I googled around and found one useful helper API - <a href="http://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-ajax">Jasmine-Ajax</a> : a set of helpers for testing AJAX requests under the Jasmine BDD framework for JavaScript.  However, now it only supports Prototype.js and jQuery.</p>

<p>I read the source and found it is not difficult to add support for ExtJS.  Hence, I modified it a bit.  Later I may submit a patch to github for this project and see whether it can be accepted.  Here I just attached the modified source first.   <a href="http://thinkingincrowd.u.qiniudn.com/mock-ajax.js">mock-ajax</a></p>

<p>How should I include this helper class to use Jasmine to test the Ajax in ExtJS?</p>
